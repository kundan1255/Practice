    <p> This example demonstrates how to assign an "onblur" event to an input element </p>
    <p> Write something in the field and click outside to lose focus (blur).</p>

    <form id="myForm">
        <input type="text" onblur="myFunction()">
    </form>

    <p><strong> Note: Firefox doesnot supports the focus in and focus out events </p></strong>

        <script>
            function myFunction() {
                alert("Input field lost focus.");
            }   
        </script>
